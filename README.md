<h2>Motivation</h2>
Before I learned HTML/CSS/Javascript to become a web developer, I'd always dreamt of creating an anime page for myself to watch without ads, which drove me to learn the necessary technology and tools required for this first "from scratch" project.

## Improve

- A better way for writing these kinds of projects in the future.
- Apply more ways and technologies needed (like Redux, useMemo, useRef, etc. for more flexibility in handling data)
- Fix bugs if it's still around, but I'm trying on other projects, so progress on this will be plodding.
